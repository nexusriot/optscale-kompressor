//! Shared spine for every kompressor surface.
//!
//! The HTTP API, the tool server and the proxy are three framings of the same
//! two operations: compress a conversation, and fetch back something a previous
//! compression elided. This crate owns those operations, the configuration that
//! shapes them, and the resolution of a credential into the tenant everything
//! durable is scoped by — so the surfaces are translation and nothing more, and
//! a rule added for one of them holds for all three.
