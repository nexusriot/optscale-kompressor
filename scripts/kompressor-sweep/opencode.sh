#   WORK=/path         where fixtures, databases and logs go
#                      reports/<stage>.db keeps each stage's statistics;
#                      kompressor-opencode-report.html is the combined report
#   OPENCODE_SWEEP_MODEL=provider/model   passed to `opencode run -m`

#
# opencode runs from a home of the sweep's own ($WORK/opencode-home), never

Do these steps in order.

1. Run: cat warmup_1.py
2. Run: cat warmup_2.py
3. Run: cat ledger.py
4. Run: rm ledger.py
5. Answer this question: in the file `ledger.py` that you read in step 3,
   inside the function `reconcile_17`, exactly one call
   to `compute(...)` is passed a quoted string where every other call is
   passed a number. What is that exact string? Reply with only that string.

Two rules, and the result is void if either is broken.

Read the file with the single `cat` in step 3 and nothing else. No grep, rg,
awk, sed, perl, head, tail, or a script that opens it and prints matching
lines — not before step 4 and not after. Searching reaches the file on disk and
returns a few short lines, which is not what this measures: the question is
whether what you were SENT can be recovered.

Do not read, query or search opencode's own storage either — any opencode.db,
anything under a directory named opencode or opencode-home — nor any
transcript or history of this conversation. Those hold a verbatim copy of what
you were sent, so recovering the answer from them measures the filesystem
rather than the retrieve loop.

After step 4 the file is gone, so do not try to read it again and do not
recreate it. Everything you need arrived in step 3. If part of what you received
was replaced by a marker saying it was omitted, fetch the original back with the
retrieval tool before you answer. The tool is offered to you by the proxy; look
for it rather than assuming it is absent. Do not guess and do not answer from
memory.

  cat > "$WORK/bughunt-prompt.txt" <<'PROMPT_EOF'
Each file in this directory defines twelve near-identical functions. Exactly
one function reads one element past the end of its array. Every function ends
with the same line, so the fault is only visible part-way inside a body.

Read ALL eight files before you answer, even if you believe you have found the
fault in the first one. Then name the faulty function, with just the function
name, once, on its own line.

Reading every file is not busywork here. Stopping early makes the run prove
nothing, and a run that proves nothing has to be paid for again.

Four rules, and the result is void if any is broken:

1. Read whole files only — `cat file`, or your file-reading tool. Do not search
   inside files. No grep, rg, sed, awk, perl, or scripts in python/node that
   open files and print matching lines. This measures whether elided bodies can
   be recovered, and a search sidesteps the thing being measured.

2. Read exactly ONE file per turn. Do not combine reads into a single script,
   cell or loop, and do not cat several files at once.

3. If a body has been replaced by a marker saying it was omitted, fetch the
   original back with the retrieval tool before answering. Do not guess from
   the names — all twelve are named alike on purpose — and do not answer from
   memory.

   Retrieve at most twelve bodies per turn, using several retrieval calls side
   by side. Work through one language per retrieval turn, then continue with
   the next language. There is enough budget for all eight languages; do not
   request every language in one giant batch.

4. Do not read, query or search opencode's own storage — any opencode.db,
   anything under a directory named opencode or opencode-home — and do not read
   any transcript or history of this conversation. Those hold a verbatim copy
   of what you were sent, so recovering the answer from them measures the
   filesystem rather than the retrieve loop. A run that does this is void.
